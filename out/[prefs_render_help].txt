;91CB7FE93510C1F4=Sets the audio block size used when rendering. It is recommended that you leave this blank, which will automatically use the last audio blocksize used.
;B8630E9E7BA232E0=When checked, configured multiprocessing settings will be used for rendering. If unchecked, rendering will be slower but can be more reliable with some plug-ins.
;EB16C6EA76EEC12B=When checked, limit apply FX/render stems actions to realtime. This is good for certain plug-ins that fail when running faster than realtime.
;3694C4CB232416C4=Rendering the project or stems, or freezing tracks, can run beyond the last media item in the project, to be sure to record any FX tails (like reverb).
;ABF1A1194368E588=When rendering stems for the entire project, apply the tail length setting. This also affects the default tail settings in the render window.
;5182449DA30570C3=When rendering stems for a time selection, apply the tail length setting. This also affects the default tail settings in the render window.
;C3F651989CF94DE1=By default, only media items will be rendered when freezing. If there are FX on the track, the entire track can be rendered, which may be slower.
;4880D33AC87DEEDF=When freezing an entire track, apply the tail length setting.
;8698FA17FC900341=By default, overs (samples over +0 dbFS, potential digital clipping) will be marked in the peaks display when rendering.
;00558A47D8A072CF=Automatically close the render status window after render has completed, you can change this option from within the render window itself.
;D63A4C5E2504D8E6=Various statistics can be calculated and displayed when rendering.
;C0879623E749667F=If freezing a track with muted items, generate silent items so that the presence of muted items is known.
