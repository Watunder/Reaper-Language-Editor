;4EE204156D89D4D5=Volume envelopes can be scaled by amplitude (half as high is half as loud), or by the track fader scale (envelope height corresponds to the track fader).
;058F8E251BC33C9E=Changing scaling for an existing envelope may change the sound, because changes on the track fader are not linearly equivalent to changes in amplitude.
;0614CE6C05F547EB=The default fader gain for newly created tracks. The factory default is +0dB
;583D434BE1F4936A=When enabled, new tracks will be visible in the mixer.

;16F5F8078D3F839C=Automatically show pre-FX pan envelopes for new tracks.
;46293FD16449C446=Default point shape for new track envelopes.
;798A8BC8BB77A088=The default automation mode for new tracks.  The factory default is Trim/Read Mode.
;01966E3463989F62=Default track height in new projects. This is also set via File/Project Settings/Save as default project settings.

;3314D8F8A63D0350=Automatically enable Free Item Positioning for new tracks.
;98FA43DA61B338EE=Automatically record-arm new tracks.
;1E7C6F759324FBD1=Default record settings for new tracks.
;CBB4206A82B6C0A2=Default gain for new track-to-track sends.
;B3B008304E94DF56=Default gain for new hardware outputs.
;AA0925ABD83BC541=Default send type for new sends and hardware outputs.
;5B0472B23A6FDB71=When enabled, new sends will send MIDI from the source track.
;4EB8C05F0CB68BBA=When enabled, new sends will send audio from the source track.
