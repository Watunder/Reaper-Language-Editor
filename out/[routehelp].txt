;165EBFAD547C2786=In a REAPER project, audio signals can be routed between hardware, tracks, and other ASIO-enabled applications.
;82F995F7720559E9=Detailed routing for tracks and hardware can be visualized and edited using the project routing matrix (View/Routing Matrix).
;25AC41C1FA136A40=Each track can have up to 64 audio channels. Tracks can send audio from any channel on the sending track, to any channel on the receiving track.
;58AE5264D4779F4C=Media items on a track can have up to 64 audio channels, which are output by default to the matching track channels.
;591EDC24B6EB457A=Detailed routing for individual tracks can be visualized and edited using the track routing dialog (click the track I/O routing button).
;994346CC39A89189=Tracks can host track FX, and media item takes can host per-take FX.
;9D39235B1E64F00C=Track FX can receive audio from any track channels, and output audio to any track channels.
;25979D811E089930=Take FX can receive audio from any media item channels, and output audio to any track channels.
;A50C284AAE0C571D=Detailed routing for any FX can also be visualized and edited using the plug-in pin connector dialog (click the FX in/out button).
;0A205373C4A0113C=FX sidechaining is using one audio signal (the source signal) to trigger an effect that is applied to another audio signal (the target signal).
;B370D4C8DAB2AB19=This can be accomplished by creating a send from the source track, to higher-numbered channels on the target track.
;2FF7B7BBD63B2DC7=For example, to use the stereo output of track A as a sidechain input for an FX on track B, create a send from track A channels 1+2 to track B channels 3+4.
;CC30DC3E75F9CB9B=Sends can be created using the Routing Matrix, or the track routing dialog on either the source or target tracks, or by simply dragging the source track I/O routing button to the target track.
;0601C02A4C024328=If the specific FX natively supports sidechaining, the sidechain input should be automatically enabled when channels 3+4 on the target track are created.
;25F406A6FE306091=This can be verified and edited using the plug-in pin connector dialog.
;43A0E154FDDCDAAC=The sidechain inputs may appear in the pin connector dialog as FX inputs marked \"auxiliary\", \"key\", or \"sidechain\".
;428C02BA77ABCF7A=If the FX does not natively support sidechaining, it can still be sidechained, using parameter modulation.
;DB6FAC1D825BAD56=Create a sidechain send as above, but do not assign the sidechain input to any FX inputs.
;95A3E2AD984E47F2=Use the Param button on the FX dialog to open parameter modulation for the target FX parameter.
;99127C329DB7C3BA=In the parameter modulation dialog, enable the audio control signal section, and select the higher-numbered track audio channel as input.
;C5B437799E11EEBA=To sidechain multiple FX on a single track or take, create even more channels.
;5CB7501FF919CE10=For example, to use track A as source input to an FX on track C, and track B as source input for another FX on track C, create a send from track A to track C channels 3+4, and another send from track B to track C channels 5+6.
;5435755F816072BE=Using the pin connector dialog (or parameter modulation) for the first FX, enable track channels 3+4 as sidechain inputs (which should happen automatically, if the FX natively supports sidechaining).
;C7860347824575D2=Using the pin connector dialog (or parameter modulation) for the second FX, enable track channels 5+6 as sidechain inputs (which will not happen automatically).
