;429342ABE696E608=Auto-detect the number of CPU cores in your system and use all of them.
;DB46AD1EC81087FA=The number of audio processing threads to create. This is usually set to the number of CPUs in your system.
;88ED4AE8DA0B9791=The relative thread priority to use for audio processing. This is an advanced performance tweak and should probably be left on the default.
;CBDC58413A534831=How aggressive audio processing threads are. A more relaxed setting will use less CPU but will be less stable at low latencies.
;CD7C691E80E72934=Media buffering uses RAM and CPU to avoid having to wait for disk IO. For systems with slower disks this should be set higher. Zero disables buffering.
;41E5ED5B864C805A=Disable buffering on tracks with MIDI editors open, which allows faster playback response to MIDI edits (recommended).
;3F29804EB743FBAD=How full source media buffers should be before starting playback. Lower numbers will give faster response time.
;E565AD880D79DFEF=When per-take FX are showing, use a lower media buffer size to minimize lag between audio playback and the visual response of the plugin.
;F2A0039FE6DFC2E5=Live FX multiprocessing allows live monitoring to be multiprocessed in addition to media/FX, but isn't ideal for low latency performance.
;7A0294314A050740=How many threads to use for Live FX multiprocessing.
;8675235AE1C1D1F9=Use spare CPU to render FX ahead of time. This is beneficial regardless of CPU count, but may need to be disabled for use with some plug-ins (UAD).
;008F35D03C09AE19=Higher render-ahead times will use multiple processors more efficiently.  Lower render-ahead times will lower response time for FX tweaks.
;85CC0E1AA9B38417=Use anticipative (render-ahead) processing on all tracks (even tracks without FX). This can help performance at the lowest latencies but uses more CPU.
;61655478AEFF607A=Use anticipative (render-ahead) FX processing on tracks with open MIDI editors. Disable this for lower preview latency while editing.
;8079420B13150577=Advanced disk buffering options, only recommended for expert use.
;5522B2898DF46E8F=Disable buffering on selected tracks, which allows faster audio playback response to edits.
