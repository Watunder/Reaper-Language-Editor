;9BC0C987FB152EF3=The project timebase controls how media items, track envelopes, and project markers behave when the project tempo changes.
;22FA51842F34ED1C=Timebase beats (position, length, rate):
;258B8B4C29B47F3A=Project elements will keep their position and length constant as measured in beats.
;F9875EFDC712951D= Media item playback rate will speed up if the tempo is increased, or slow down if the tempo is decreased.
;A7FD975F9982EA5E= This is the default project timebase.
;947209E3761D59D2=Timebase beats (position only):
;7B01F9885A6B05D3=Project elements will keep their position constant as measured in beats, but media item length will remain constant as measured in seconds.
;F1E4CF9D444F2E8E=Timebase time:
;881F82A3EF7FB5F6=Project elements will keep their position and length constant as measured in seconds.
;43FF89D771CB0002= Positions and media item length will change as measured in beats, if the tempo is changed.
;602BE0E5EB4C411A= This was the default project timebase prior to REAPER version 4.25.
;9BF9B3C72DA9AA9D=Tempo and time signature change markers have timebase beats by default, regardless of the project timebase.
;AE7BB4D8A52481FB= This behavior can also be changed in File/Project Settings.
;ABB2015608E8899E=The timebase for individual tracks and media items can be set independently of the project timebase.
;6BF51A7CD81FAB00= MIDI media items always have timebase beats (position, length, rate).
;F95AEE56B041FBEA= The timebase for individual MIDI media items can be locked to a specific tempo regardless of the project tempo, in the media item source properties.
