;0AC04A1CB92456D8=By default, middle C (MIDI note 60) is labeled C4, A=440Hz (MIDI note 69) is A4. A display offset of -1 causes these notes to be labeled C3/A3, etc.
;82AF1C34E7B0ADBB=Pooled (ghosted) MIDI source data can be converted to a separate editable media item (un-pooled) by gluing the media item.
;5BBF579F8E4BF588=The default format for storing new MIDI items. In-project items allow more flexible editing, and can be exported as .MID files at any time.
;295E0DAF4479EFCF=New MIDI items will be stored as native REAPER data inside the project file (.RPP), which allows more flexible editing and preserves note selections.
;31B5B66F8646D354=New MIDI items will be stored as .MID files on disk, which is less flexible for editing but more portable.
;43EFCC9F983AEC6C=Prompt for a filename when creating new items as .MID files (otherwise a unique but not very meaningful name will be used).
;AAEF9CB36FAF4F81=Imported MIDI files can be automatically converted to in-project items.

;215AD4578BB1650E=Multichannel MIDI files can be imported to a single track, or to separate tracks per channel.
;1337B5AA5353A527=Data resolution for new MIDI items. 960ppq is two ticks per millisecond at 120bpm, which is suitable for almost all purposes.
;310C2E90734D1CC9=When splitting a MIDI item, add a note-off message for any notes that span the split point.
;42FC32E49ABBB4BB=When importing a MIDI file, time signature change events can be snapped to whole measures (recommended).

;15E55A91FD5A7038=Right mouse drag in the MIDI editor can sweep-delete CC events, or marquee select CC events. Use the alt key to toggle behavior.
;59D5C1D4A8F24931=Prompt to import tempo map when importing MIDI files with simple tempo information (hold control when importing to temporarily toggle).
;B06D01F81E40F4EF=When importing a single-channel MIDI file that contains lyrics or other meta-events, obey the user preference for importing multichannel MIDI.
;D76E00820D574366=Timeout touch-replace recording when a CC/pitch message hasn't been sent in this many millseconds
;518F0FD676C6EAC9=Default PPQ for non-square CC segment interpolation -- this is configurable per-MIDI item; new items are created with this value.
